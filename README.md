# git-kiss

Keep It Simple, Stupid — a dead-simple CLI wrapper for git and github cli (optional) for clean git workflows.

`gk` wraps common git operations into short commands that keep your branch history clean and linear. Most operations use **rebasing** to avoid unnecessary merge commits and keep your history easy to follow. The one exception is `gk ff` (feature finish), which uses a **merge commit with `--no-ff`** so you can always see where a feature was integrated.

## Install

**Homebrew:**

```bash
brew tap marcjeffrey/git-kiss
brew install git-kiss
```

**curl:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcjeffrey/git-kiss/main/install.sh | bash
```

## Quick Start

```bash
cd your-repo
gk init              # create a .gitkiss config (choose full or simple flow)
gk nf <feature-name> # start a feature branch
# ... make changes, commit ...
gk pf                # publish branch to remote
gk pr <title>        # create a pull request (requires gh CLI)
gk rf                # rebase feature with latest base branch changes
gk ff                # finish feature (merge into base branch)
```

## Commands

| Command           | Description                                                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `gk nf "<name>"`  | **New feature** — create a feature branch from the base branch          |
| `gk ff` / `ff!`   | **Finish feature** — merge feature into base branch (merge commit)      |
| `gk sf` / `sf!`   | **Squash feature** — rebase onto base and squash all commits into one   |
| `gk cm "<msg>"`   | **Commit** — add all changes and commit with message                    |
| `gk pf`           | **Publish feature** — push feature branch to remote                     |
| `gk pr "<title>"` | **Pull request** — create a PR via `gh` CLI (supports extra `gh` flags) |
| `gk rf`           | **Rebase feature** — rebase feature against base branch                 |
| `gk ds` / `ds!`   | **Deploy staging** — rebase feature onto staging branch                 |
| `gk dp` / `dp!`   | **Deploy production** — rebase develop into main and tag a release      |
| `gk init`         | **Init** — generate a `.gitkiss` config file                            |
| `gk help`         | **Help** — show usage                                                   |

### Pull Requests

`gk pr` requires a title and automatically targets the base branch. Any additional flags are passed directly to [`gh pr create`](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_pr_create):

```bash
gk pr "Add user authentication"
gk pr "Fix login bug" --draft
gk pr "Update API" --reviewer octocat --label enhancement
gk pr "Refactor auth" --body "Switched to JWT tokens"
```

## How It Works

git-kiss uses **rebasing** for almost everything. This keeps your commit history linear and easy to read — no tangled merge spaghetti. The only exception is `gk ff` which creates a **merge commit** (`--no-ff`) so you can clearly see where each feature was integrated.

### Full Flow

Branches: `main` ← `develop` ← `feature/*` with `staging` and release tags.

Best for teams with a release process, staging environment, and versioned deploys.

```
main         ●─────────────────────────●──── v1.0.1
              \                       /
develop        ●───●───●─────●───●───●
                \     /       \     /
feature/login    ●──●     feature/signup
                              ●──●

staging        ●───●───●  (rebased from feature for testing)
```

**What happens at each step:**

```
gk nf <initial>-<feature-name> →  develop ──branch──→ feature/login
                                   (rebase: pull latest develop first)

gk rf                          →  feature/login is rebased onto latest develop
                                   (rebase: clean linear history)

gk ff                          →  feature/login ──merge──→ develop
                                   (merge commit: marks where feature was integrated)

gk ds                          →  feature/signup ──rebase──→ staging
                                   (rebase: staging gets feature commits on top)

gk dp                          →  develop ──rebase──→ main + tag v1.0.1
                                   (rebase: main stays linear, tag marks release)
```

### Simple Flow

Branches: `main` ← `feature/*` — no develop branch, no staging, no tags.

Best for small teams or projects that deploy directly from main.

```
main         ●───●───●─────●───●───●
              \     /       \     /
feature/login  ●──●     feature/signup
                              ●──●
```

**What happens at each step:**

```
gk nf login         →  main ──branch──→ feature/login
                        (rebase: pull latest main first)

gk rf               →  feature/login is rebased onto latest main
                        (rebase: clean linear history)

gk ff               →  feature/login ──merge──→ main
                        (merge commit: marks where feature was integrated)
```

### Why rebase + merge commit?

- **Rebase everywhere else** keeps the history linear. No unnecessary merge commits cluttering up `git log`.
- **Merge commit on finish** (`--no-ff`) creates a single marker in history showing exactly when a feature landed. You can always find it with `git log --merges`.

The result is a clean, readable history:

```
* abc1234  Merge branch 'feature/login' into develop
|\
| * def5678  Add login validation
| * ghi9012  Add login form
|/
* jkl3456  Merge branch 'feature/signup' into develop
|\
| * mno7890  Add signup flow
|/
* pqr1234  Initial commit
```

## Configuration

git-kiss looks for config in two places (repo overrides global):

| Location      | Scope                                                 |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `~/.git-kiss` | Global defaults for all repos                         |
| `.gitkiss`    | Per-repo config (commit this to share with your team) |

Run `gk init` to generate a config interactively, or create one manually:

```bash
# Full flow
MAIN_BRANCH=main
DEVELOP_BRANCH=develop
STAGING_BRANCH=staging
FEATURE_PREFIX=feature/
USE_TAGS=true
INITIALS=
```

```bash
# Simple flow
MAIN_BRANCH=main
DEVELOP_BRANCH=
STAGING_BRANCH=
FEATURE_PREFIX=feature/
USE_TAGS=false
INITIALS=
```

| Key              | Default    | Description                                              |
| ---------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MAIN_BRANCH`    | `main`     | Production branch                                        |
| `DEVELOP_BRANCH` | `develop`  | Integration branch (leave empty for simple flow)         |
| `STAGING_BRANCH` | `staging`  | Staging branch (leave empty if unused)                   |
| `FEATURE_PREFIX` | `feature/` | Prefix for feature branches                              |
| `USE_TAGS`       | `true`     | Auto-increment semver tags on `gk dp`                    |
| `INITIALS`       |            | Your initials, prepended to feature branches (e.g. `mj`) |

## Requirements

- **git** (obviously)
- **gh** (GitHub CLI) — only needed for `gk pr`. [Install here](https://cli.github.com).
